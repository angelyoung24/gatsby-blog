title: about me
---

<p>I am a Front-End Developer / Designer accepting clients for
freelance work and seeking full time work. I attended the now -
defunct The New York Code + Design Academy for Full Stack Web
Development. I also volunteer for Code for Philly and Philly Tech
Sistas.</p>
<p>I have experience in HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript,
Angular, React, Ionic, JQuery, Ruby, Sinatra, Python, WordPress /
CMS, and Ruby on Rails. Through my time at the boot camp, I 've
learned to grasp concepts quickly and adapt to different situations.</p>
<p>I am continuing to learn new languages and technologies in a further
pursuit of self - study. I attend a number of meetups per month to
one tech conference a year.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I learned to develop small fan sites
using HTML and CSS. I wanted to be a web developer after realizing
actually wanted to do full time. Google On The Edge: Edgemont for my
first fan site built on Tripod (actually donâ€™t google it you may get
a virus.)</p>
<p>I am Vice President Education of Panorama Toastmasters, a local
chapter of Toastmasters International and I volunteer at WHYY, the
Philadelphia affiliate of PBS(Public Broadcast Systems), when ever
they need me. In my spare time, I listen to podcasts and watch
YouTube videos. I am a lifelong fan of pop culture with an emphasis
on soap operas. I do some photography from my Galaxy S8.</p>
